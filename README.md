## Project Definition

_A patisserie menu project aims at creating design and developing the interface of the products by listing and categorizing them throughout the scope of the MVP. For further implementation, the current product will be served within the larger boundaries of the MVP by expanding it with a CRM admin dashboard and dynamic product listing._

<br />

> Due to getting quite tiny project which requires minimal effort, I've decided to push the limits of mine by focusing the project for the entire day, thus I could put a new achivement to my developer journey shelf like _Hands-on Pro-I_, imagine like a badge you giving yourself

## QR automation superficial project report

### Project Definition

It includes a mobile web application where customers can access the menu and more by scanning QR codes on the tables inside the shop.

### Project purpose

To minimize the maximum workforce by increasing the service speed of employees with customers during working hours.

### Desired specifications

1. The products and pricing offered in the specified menu to be used in the user interface.
2. A simple interface, the name of the product and its price were considered sufficient.
3. QR code support that allows customers to be directed to the web application, i.e. the menu, by scanning it from the cameras of mobile devices.

### Extra features developed

In addition to the items mentioned above,

- Integrated discount mechanism for products.
- Added a button that gives directions to the location of the shop when pressed.
- Google Maps integration has been improved, showing the location of the shop interactively.
- Scrolling animations have been added to make the products stand out more and be taken into consideration by customers.
- Due to the constant changes in pricing, the infrastructure work of the product management panel, which has a high potential to be developed into software in the future, was carried out within the project and the entire architecture was prepared.
- An animated opening screen was developed to make the brand name more evocative in the eyes of customers.
- The project was implemented in the most efficient way by using the latest technology hosting and internet services.

### Performance

After the completion of the project, various essential tests were carried out. The purpose of these tests was to measure the support of the interface by browsers and devices.

As a result, loading issues were fixed for some older devices, and our website/application ran smoothly on almost all mobile devices with a 92% success rate.

### Next steps,

I believe that the development of a ‚Äúproduct dashboard‚Äù instead of constantly changing the pricing each time with manual programming will play an important role in the long run in terms of sustainability as well as speed.

## For developers

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Clone the project using CLI:

```bash
gh repo clone Masculinn/beyaz-kose-patisserie-restaurant-system
```

or

```bash
git clone
```

then run

```bash
npm install
```

Everything that works on the background of the app comes from one `lib` file which is `data.lib.ts` inside of `/src/lib` directory.

```ts

// simply modify the properties to integrate your own datasets
// Add visually discount that will strikehold the actual increased price on UI by adding percentage property.

import { ProductCategory } from "@/interfaces";

export default {
  beverages: {
    title: "Category title",
    desc: "Category description",
    items: [
      { item: "Item Title", price: { fixed: 99 } },
      { item: "Discounted Item Title", price: { fixed: 100, percentage: 20 } },
    ],
  },
  deserts: {
    title: "Category title 2",
    desc: "Category description 2",
    items: [
      { item: "Item Title", price: { fixed: 100, percentage: 20 } },
      { item: "Discounted Item Title", price: { fixed: percentage: 20 } },
    ],
  },
} satisfies ProductCategory;
```
